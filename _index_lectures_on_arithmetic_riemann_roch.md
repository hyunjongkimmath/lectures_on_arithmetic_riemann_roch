**Title:**​ Local version of the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck Theorem

  

**Abstract:**​ The main goal of this series of lectures is to present a curvature theorem of Bismut-Gillet-Soulé, which can be seen as a local version of the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem. Recall that for a proper holomorphic map between smooth quasi-projective manifolds, the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem gives a formula in the cohomology of the target manifold for the Chern characters of direct image sheaves in terms of the Chern and Todd classes of the fibration.  Bismut-Gillet-Soulé established that under some additional assumptions on the family, this statement holds on the level of differential forms. 

  

More precisely, recall that Chern-Weil theory associates for any Hermitian vector bundle and a characteristic class a natural closed differential form, the de Rham cohomology of which coincides with the characteristic class of the vector bundle. The curvature formula states that one can construct a natural norm on the determinant of the direct images, called the Quillen norm, so that the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem holds pointwise for the differential forms constructed as the Chern-Weil representatives of both sides of the Riemann-Roch-Grothendieck theorem. 

  

We will cover the basic elements of the proof of this result as well as the needed preliminaries including Hodge theory, Chern-Weil and Bott-Chern theories, Spectral theory of elliptic operators, Heat kernel asymptotics, local index theory and theory of superconnections.
